For those of you that are unfamiliar with Sinatra, Sinatra is a Rack-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) that is utilized in creating web applications. Including Sinatra in your projects unlocks a ton of useful methods and adds some functionality to your application. In today's blog I want to take you through one of the many add-on features that have been built around Sinatra, specifically, Sinatra::ContentFor, which is a part of Sinatra::Contrib.

If you have worked with Sinatra before, you have certainly become familiar with the convential file system associated with Sinatra apps.
