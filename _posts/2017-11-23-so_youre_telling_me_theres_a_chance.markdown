If you had asked me a year ago, "Chris, what are the odds of you becoming a software engineer?", I would have laughed in your face. Okay, maybe not, because that would be rude. I would have, however, politely informed you that the odds of me becoming a software engineer were roughly the same as the odds of me becoming an astronaut, or perhaps a professional athlete. To put a number on it, I would say maybe 1 out of a million. But alas, here I am, writing this blog post about how/why I got into coding. So, you may ask, what changed? Well, calm down, I'm getting there.

It all began 27 years ago, on a beautiful June morn---no, I kid. In all honesty, the shift was born not three months ago, out of frustration and desperation more than anything else. You see, last year I graduated with my BS in Geology, a field in which I thought I would be able to eke out a comfortable living doing something I enjoyed. After graduation I dove into my job search with the tenacity and vigor only possible from one who has not yet had their soul crushed by an unforgiving job market. I sent out resumes to every employment opportunity under the sun, qualified or not, and eagerly awaited the responses. But they didn't come. Months passed and my optimism turned to frustration, and then frustration gave way to despair. Okay, thats a little dramatic, I admit, but constant rejection does take a toll on one's sense of self-worth. So, after sixteen months of searching (and delivering pizzas), I decided that it was time for me to reevaluate my life and my goals for the future.

Everybody knows that the tech field is the place to be, its no big secret, and so naturally it was my first consideration. But I didn't have a clue where to start. I was not exactly a "tech" guy. I mean, I typed with two fingers and I couldn't tell you what a router did. I barely know how to use my cell phone beyond making and receiving phone calls. Until last year I was calling emojis emoticons, and if I am being totally honest, I STILL don't really know what a meme is. Despite it all though, I decided to take the plunge. After all, what did I have to lose? Nothing. So I took to the internet, the world's largest library, to gain my bearings.

I decided to adopt a policy of full immersion. Round the clock bombardment of all things computing. I was bouncing around the plenitude of free developer resources available, reading books on the history of computing, listening to engineers' podcasts when I barely understood half of what they were saying, watching historical documentaries such as HBO's Silicon Valley, anything and everything I could do to learn more about coding. I was doing it. Right away, I knew I liked it. Behind every line of code lies a cold, hard, mathematical logic, but yet, it can be expressed so elequently, even artistically, in a way that I had never before encountered in my studies. It is that juxtaposition, logic and expression, that entices me. That is what drew me into development and led me here, to the Flatiron School.


So my journey begins... I guess even a one in a million chance is still a chance.
